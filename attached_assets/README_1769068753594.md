## 🎚️ Maturity Levels (Choose Before Starting)

| Level | Speed | Security | Testing | Use When |
|-------|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **[SPIKE]** | 🚀 Fast | Input validation only | Mocks | Prototype, POC, exploration |
| **[PROD]** | 🐢 Thorough | Full OWASP gates | Unit + integration + E2E | Production-ready code |
| **[SKEPTIC]** | 🔬 Deep | Full + questioning | Full + edge cases | Critical systems, high-risk |

**Default:** Assume **[PROD]** if no prefix specified.

**How to use:**
```bash
# Example: Fast prototype
[SPIKE] Use 03-development/01-feature-implementation.md

# Example: Production feature
[PROD] Use 03-development/01-feature-implementation.md

# Example: Critical security feature
[SKEPTIC] Use 03-development/01-feature-implementation.md
```

---

## 🛡️ Security Baseline (Always Active)

**ALL prompts inherit these guardrails:**
- Input validation (whitelist, never blacklist)
- Output sanitization (no secrets, no stack traces)
- Error handling (Cause → Fix → Retry)
- Rate limiting (prevent abuse)
- Audit logging (immutable, 90+ days)

**See:** `SECURITY_BASELINE.md` for full 5-layer castle defense model.

## 🚨 Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Skipping Planning
**Problem:** Jumping straight to code without requirements  
**Result:** Rework, wasted time, wrong solution  
**Fix:** ALWAYS start at 01-planning/01-requirements-gathering.md

### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Phase Order
**Problem:** Writing tests before code, deploying before testing  
**Result:** Broken deploys, untested code in production  
**Fix:** Follow workflow sequence (Plan → Design → Dev → Test → Deploy → Ops)

### ❌ Mistake 3: Mixing Maturity Levels
**Problem:** Starting with [SPIKE], deploying as [PROD] without upgrade  
**Result:** Production system with prototype-level security  
**Fix:** Explicitly upgrade: [SPIKE] → [PROD] with full security review

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Security Phase
**Problem:** Treating security as "Phase 8" means "do last"  
**Result:** Retrofitting security is 10x harder than building it in  
**Fix:** Run Phase 8 prompts IN PARALLEL with other phases

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Requirements Gathering
**Problem:** "I know what I need" without writing it down  
**Result:** Scope creep, missed edge cases, unclear success criteria  
**Fix:** Always use 01-requirements-gathering.md, even for "obvious" tasks

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Prompt doesn't fit my use case  
**Fix:** Check `99-shared/COMMON_PATTERNS.md` for adaptations

**Issue:** Output quality low  
**Fix:** Upgrade maturity level: [SPIKE] → [PROD] → [SKEPTIC]

**Issue:** Unknown unknowns blocking progress  
**Fix:** Read `UNKNOWN_UNKNOWNS_AUDIT.md` for gap analysis

**Issue:** Prompt contradicts my stack (not Next.js/React)  
**Fix:** Override stack defaults in prompt inputs

**Issue:** Security guardrails too strict  
**Fix:** Justify exceptions in writing, document risk acceptance

**Flag issues:** "BUNDLE_ISSUE: [phase]/[prompt-name] [description]"
