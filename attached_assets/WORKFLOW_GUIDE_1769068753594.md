## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Don't know where to start  
**Fix:** Use decision tree at top of this guide

**Issue:** Phase doesn't apply to my use case  
**Fix:** Check fast-track scenarios (hotfix, bug fix, refactor)

**Issue:** Output quality low  
**Fix:** Upgrade maturity level: [SPIKE] → [PROD] → [SKEPTIC]

**Issue:** Phases taking too long  
**Fix:** Check duration estimates table; adjust scope if way over

**Issue:** Skipped a phase, now stuck  
**Fix:** Go back and complete skipped phase (don't skip Quality!)
