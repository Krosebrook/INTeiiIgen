# Refactor — Safe Code Improvements

## TL;DR
Improve code clarity without changing behavior.

## Inputs
- `code` (file or snippet)
- `language` (typescript/python/etc)

## Output Contract
1. Refactored code (ready to commit)
2. What changed, why, what didn't
3. Risk assessment

## Guardrails
- [ ] No behavior changes
- [ ] No new dependencies unless justified
- [ ] All tests pass

## Example
Input: Duplicated logic
Output: Extracted helper function, tests still pass
