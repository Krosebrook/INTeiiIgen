# Debug — Root Cause Analysis

## TL;DR
Find why code failed and fix it safely.

## Inputs
- `error_message` (stack trace)
- `code` (relevant snippet)
- `runtime_context` (browser/server)

## Output Contract
1. Root cause (specific, measurable)
2. Minimal fix
3. Prevention test
4. Cause → Fix → Retry pattern

## Example
Cause: DB connection pool exhausted (50/50)
Fix: Scale pool to 100 in dashboard
Retry: Yes, in 30s with exponential backoff
