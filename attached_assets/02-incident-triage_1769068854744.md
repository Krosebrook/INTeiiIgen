# Incident Triage — Fast Response

## TL;DR
Quick diagnostic tree for failures.

## Inputs
- `symptom` (500 errors/slow page/etc)
- `logs` (error logs)

## Output Contract
1. Triage tree (decision flowchart)
2. Likely causes (prioritized)
3. Immediate mitigations (<5 min)
4. Post-incident fixes

## Example: API 500 Errors
1. Recent deploy? → YES → Rollback
2. DB connection errors? → YES → Scale pool
3. Third-party API down? → YES → Circuit breaker
4. Memory spiking? → YES → Scale horizontally
