- [ ] OpenAI Evals (evals)
- [ ] Git (versioning)
- [ ] LangSmith (observability, free tier: 5K traces/month)
- [ ] Helicone (cost tracking, free tier: 10K requests/month)
- [ ] Label Studio (data labeling, open source)

### Test Accounts Needed:
- [ ] OpenAI API ($50 credit for testing)
- [ ] Anthropic API ($5 credit for testing)
- [ ] Google Gemini (free tier)

### Time Commitment:
- **Option 1 (Fast):** 2 hours/day × 6 weeks = 84 hours
  - You: 60 hours (execute)
  - Me: 24 hours (review)

## Validation Plan

### Week 1 Validation (Evals):
```bash
# Can we run an eval?
deepeval test --file test_prompt.py

# Expected: Test passes, metrics calculated
# Failure: Can't run evals → Week 1 incomplete
```

### Week 2 Validation (Versioning):
```bash
# Can we version a prompt?
git tag prompt-v1.0.0
git log --oneline prompts/

# Expected: Tags exist, changelog updated
# Failure: No version control → Week 2 incomplete
```

### Week 6 Validation (Complete):
```bash
# Can we run full workflow?
1. Create eval dataset → Phase 4.6
2. Design eval metrics → Phase 4.5
3. Run eval in CI → CI/CD Integration
4. Version prompt → Phase 9
5. Deploy with feature flag → Phase 5
6. Monitor in production → Phase 11

# Expected: All steps work end-to-end
# Failure: Gaps remain → Not production-ready
```

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative:
- [ ] 78/78 prompts complete (100%)
- [ ] 0 stub files remaining
- [ ] <5% prompt failure rate in testing
- [ ] <10 min to run full eval suite
- [ ] <$1 cost to test all prompts

### Qualitative:
- [ ] User can follow workflow start-to-finish
- [ ] Each prompt has realistic example
- [ ] Documentation is clear (non-expert can use)
- [ ] No "how do I..." questions unanswered
- [ ] Industry experts validate completeness

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Mitigation:** Fixed scope (78 prompts). No additions until v4.0 ships.

### Risk 2: Quality Slip
**Mitigation:** Quality gates enforced. Review every prompt.

### Risk 3: Timeline Overrun
**Mitigation:** Weekly checkpoints. Red/yellow/green status. Descope if needed.

### Risk 4: Tool Changes
**Mitigation:** Use stable tools (DeepEval, Git). Document versions.

### Risk 5: Burnout
**Mitigation:** 1-2 hours/day max. Sustainable pace. Celebrate milestones.

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily:
- 10 min standup (what's done, what's next, blockers)

### Weekly:
- 30 min review (quality check, adjust plan)
- Ship weekly progress update

### Milestones:
- Week 1: Evals working → Celebrate 🎉
- Week 2: Versioning working → Celebrate 🎉
- Week 3: Stubs complete → Celebrate 🎉
- Week 6: v4.0 ships → BIG celebration 🎊

---

## Post-Launch (v4.0)

### Maintenance:
- Quarterly review (update for new tools, best practices)
- User feedback incorporation
- Version bumps (v4.1, v4.2, etc.)

### Community:
- Open-source on GitHub
- Accept contributions
- Build community of prompt engineers

### Monetization (Optional):
- Pro tier with advanced prompts
- Consulting / implementation services
- Training courses

## Decision Time

**Option A: Build v4.0 (Recommended)**
- **Timeline:** 6 weeks
- **Effort:** 308 hours total
- **Result:** Industry-leading prompt bundle
- **Risk:** Medium (scope, time)

**Option B: Ship v3.0 as "Foundation"**
- **Timeline:** Now
- **Effort:** 0 hours
- **Result:** 26% complete bundle
- **Risk:** Low (already done) but reputation risk (incomplete)

**Option C: Hybrid — Ship Critical First**
- **Timeline:** 2 weeks (Week 1-2 only)
- **Effort:** 98 hours
- **Result:** v3.5 with evals + versioning (60% complete)
- **Risk:** Low (focused scope)

**My Recommendation:** Option C → Ship v3.5 in 2 weeks, then v4.0 in 6 weeks total.
