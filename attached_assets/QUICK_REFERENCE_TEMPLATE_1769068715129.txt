"Before you analyze, here's my context:
[Paste your answers from above]

Now please:

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR:

🚩 If answer jumps to solution without asking questions
🚩 If answer gives only ONE recommendation
🚩 If answer optimizes for "industry standard" not YOUR needs
🚩 If answer doesn't flag critical dependencies
🚩 If answer says "build everything before shipping"
🚩 If answer doesn't show effort estimates
🚩 If answer is all criticism, no acknowledgment of what's good

If you see these, STOP and say:
"Please use discovery-first protocol - ask about my goals first"
