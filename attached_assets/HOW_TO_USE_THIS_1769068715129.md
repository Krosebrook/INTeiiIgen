# How to Use Your New Discovery-First System

## TL;DR
I've updated my memory to ALWAYS ask discovery questions before audits. You have 3 files to reference. Use the Quick Reference card for every big request.

---

## What I've Delivered

### 1. Updated My Memory ✅
**Memory #8 (Permanent):**
```
Before audits/recommendations: ask goal, timeline, budget, stage. 
Give tiered options (quick/medium/complete), not one-size-fits-all.
```

**What this means:**
- From now on, when you ask me to audit or recommend, I'll ask questions FIRST
- I'll give you 3 tiers, not just one path
- I'll optimize for YOUR needs, not "industry best practices"

---

### 2. Three Reference Files

#### File 1: DISCOVERY_FIRST_RULES.md (555 lines)
**What:** 15 rules I follow when helping you
**When to read:** When you want to understand my thinking
**Key sections:**
- Rule 1: Discovery questions (mandatory)
- Rule 2: Critical dependency detection
- Rule 3: 80/20 analysis
- Rule 4: Tiered options
- Rule 15: Done > Perfect check

**Use this:** To understand why I ask certain questions

---

#### File 2: QUICK_REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.txt (Plain text)
**What:** Copy-paste template for YOU to use
**When to use:** Every time you ask for audits/recommendations
**How to use:**
1. Fill out the 7 questions (takes 2 minutes)
2. Paste into your request
3. Get tailored recommendations back

**Use this:** Keep it open in a text editor, fill out before big requests

**Example:**
```
Before you analyze, here's my context:

1. Building: [X] Product to sell
2. End user: [X] External customers
3. Goal: Help developers ship AI faster
4. Timeline: [X] 1-2 weeks
5. Budget: [X] <$100/month
6. Stage: [X] MVP
7. Quality: [X] PROD

Now please:
1. Flag any critical blockers
2. Give me tiered options
3. Recommend which tier fits
4. Show effort vs impact
```

---

#### File 3: DISCOVERY_TEMPLATE.md (Full version)
**What:** Complete discovery protocol with examples
**When to use:** Reference when you need detailed examples
**Sections:**
- When to use discovery
- Full question script
- Response framework
- Real examples
- Red flags checklist

**Use this:** Deep reference when needed

## How This Changes Our Workflow

### Before (Old Way)
```
You: "Audit my prompt bundle"
Me: "You're missing 9 phases and 61 prompts. Build v4.0 in 308 hours."
You: "Um... that's too much"
```

### After (New Way)
```
You: "Audit my prompt bundle. Here's my context:
      - Building: Product to sell
      - Users: Developers
      - Timeline: 2 weeks
      - Budget: <$100/month"

Me: "Got it. You're building a product for developers.

     🔴 CRITICAL: You need evals or customers can't test outputs
         Fix: Add eval quick start (8 hours)
     
     Quick Wins (4 hours → 80% value):
     1. Add copy-paste templates (1h)
     2. Add common mistakes (2h)
     3. Add decision tree (1h)
     
     Tier 1: Ship Monday (4 hours)
     Tier 2: Ship in 2 weeks (24 hours)
     Tier 3: Ship in 2 months (100 hours)
     
     Recommendation: Tier 2 (matches your timeline + needs)
     
     Next steps:
     A) Do Tier 1 now, learn fast
     B) Do Tier 2 now, more complete
     
     Which do you prefer?"

You: "Tier 2, let's build it"
```

## What Changed in My Behavior

### I Will Now:
✅ Ask questions before analyzing
✅ Flag critical blockers upfront
✅ Give 3 tiered options (not 1)
✅ Show effort vs impact
✅ Optimize for YOUR goals
✅ Acknowledge what's good first
✅ Provide concrete next steps
✅ Challenge bad premises respectfully

### I Won't:
❌ Jump straight to solutions
❌ Assume enterprise scale
❌ Give only one recommendation
❌ Optimize for "industry standard"
❌ Criticize without acknowledging good
❌ End vaguely ("let me know")
❌ Miss critical dependencies

---

## Quick Start (For You)

### Step 1: Keep Quick Reference Handy (30 seconds)
```bash
# Option A: Print it
Print QUICK_REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.txt

# Option B: Save to desktop
Save QUICK_REFERENCE_TEMPLATE.txt to desktop

# Option C: Pin in notes app
Copy into Apple Notes / Notion / etc.
```

### Step 2: Use It On Next Request (2 minutes)
```
Next time you ask for audit/recommendation:

1. Open quick reference
2. Fill out 7 questions (2 min)
3. Paste into request
4. Get tailored answer
```

### Step 3: Validate I'm Following Rules (10 seconds)
```
Check that my response includes:
- ✅ Critical dependencies flagged
- ✅ Quick wins identified
- ✅ 3 tiered options
- ✅ Concrete recommendation
- ✅ Next steps (Option A/B)

If missing any → Remind me: "Use discovery-first protocol"
```

## Examples of When to Use This

### ALWAYS Use (Big Requests):
- "Audit my code/project"
- "What's missing from X?"
- "How should I build Y?"
- "Review my architecture"
- Any project >20 hours

### SOMETIMES Use (Medium Requests):
- "How do I implement X?"
- "What's the best way to Y?"
- "Should I use A or B?"

### NEVER Needed (Simple Requests):
- "Fix this typo"
- "What's 2+2?"
- "Explain X concept"
- "Debug this error"

**Rule of thumb:** If request has multiple valid approaches → Use discovery

## Testing It Right Now

Want to test this? Give me a request using the template:

```
Before you analyze, here's my context:

1. Building: [Fill this]
2. End user: [Fill this]
3. Goal: [Fill this]
4. Timeline: [Fill this]
5. Budget: [Fill this]
6. Stage: [Fill this]
7. Quality: [Fill this]

Now please audit my prompt bundle and give me tiered options.
```

Try it and see the difference!

## What to Expect Going Forward

### Every Time You Ask for Audit/Recommendation:

**I will ask (if you didn't provide context):**
```
Before I dive in, let me ask 5 quick questions:
1. What are you building?
2. Who's the end user?
3. What's the goal?
4. What's your timeline?
5. What problem does this solve?
```

**Then I'll deliver:**
```
Got it. You're building [X] for [Y].

🔴 CRITICAL: [Blockers that must be fixed]

Quick Wins: [20% effort, 80% value]

Tier 1: [Fast option]
Tier 2: [Balanced option]
Tier 3: [Complete option]

My recommendation: [Which tier + why]

Next steps: [Concrete actions]
```

## How to Hold Me Accountable

If I skip discovery questions, say:
> "Use discovery-first protocol - ask about my goals first"

If I give only ONE recommendation, say:
> "Give me 3 tiered options (quick/medium/complete)"

If I don't flag critical blockers, say:
> "What are the critical dependencies I'm missing?"

If I optimize for "industry standard", say:
> "Optimize for MY needs, not industry best practices"

**I should follow my own rules. Call me out if I don't.**
